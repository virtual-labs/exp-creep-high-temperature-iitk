Step 1: Take Gauge length of the sample
- Drag the vernier caliper.
- Right click on vernier caliper and click on pin.
- Place the sample on the vernier caliper.
- Take the gauge length and enter it below:
Length: [input] mm

Step 2: Take the diameter of the sample
- Right click on vernier caliper and click on unload sample.
- Now, Right click on sample and click on rotate.
- Place the sample on the vernier caliper.
- Take the diameter and enter it below:
Diameter: [input] mm

Step 3: Place sample on UTM machine.
- Right click on sample to rotate.
- Now, right click on the machine to pin.
- Now,place the sample on the machine.
- You can adjust zoom level also (Via Mouse Wheel).

Step 4: Start the test.
Click below buttons to start the machine
- Test1 for 500 MPa load
- Test2 for 549 MPa load
- Test3 for 602 MPa load
[Furnace Temp: [value] ℃]

Test 1
Time in hrs | Elongation Reading (ΔL)

Test 2
Time in hrs | Elongation Reading (ΔL)

Test 3
Time in hrs | Elongation Reading (ΔL)

Step 5: Results
Creep curves at different stresses and corresponding values obtained from creep curves.
- Region I is primary creep regime, Region II is secondary creep regime (creep rate is minimum and stable) and Region III is tertiary Creep regime
- The creep rate is increasing with increasing stress and is as represented σ3 > σ2 > σ1
- In Curve 1 (500 MPa) and 2 (549 MPa) we can clearly demarcate the primary and secondary creep. In case of 3 (602 MPa) curve the deformation is rapid and primary creep is very limited.

Applied stress (MPa) | Load 1 | Load 2 | Load 3
Minimum Creep rate (s-1) | 1.405x10-8 | 3.28x10-8 | 2.95x10-7
Instantaneous strain | 0.00764 | 0.00811 | 0.0152
Time to fracture in hrs | 128.95 | 104.03 | 16.138
Fracture elongation (%) | 2.65 | 2.89 | 3.17
